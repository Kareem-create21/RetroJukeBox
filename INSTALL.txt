TROUBLESHOOTING:

Problem: "libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file" error on Linux
Solution: Install the required OpenGL libraries
- For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx
- For Fedora: sudo dnf install mesa-libGL
- For Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S mesa

This is a common issue with PyQt5 applications on Linux systems as they require
OpenGL libraries to render the user interface. Make sure to install these packages
before running the application or you will encounter this error.

Problem: PyQt5 installation fails
Solution: Try installing via your system's package manager
- For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
- For Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-qt5
- For macOS (with Homebrew): brew install pyqt5

Problem: Python not found
Solution: Ensure Python is installed and added to your system PATH
- Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- For Windows, check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
